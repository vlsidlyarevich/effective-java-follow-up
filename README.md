# Effective Java follow-up

This is not a copyright, just my abstract of "Effective java 3rd edition"
written by [Joshua Bloch](https://twitter.com/joshbloch). I've tried to memorize the most attractive things for me, and
write some examples with easy navigation for future usages.

Please, read book first!=)

--- 
### [Object creation/destruction](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation)

**Examples:**

* [Use static factory method if needed](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/sfm/README.MD)
* [Use builder when multiple params](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/builder/README.MD)
* [Use try-with-resources instead of try-finally](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/twr/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Create and fetch singletons by private constructor or enum
- Use private constructor for non-creatable objects
- Use DI everywhere
- Avoid extra Object creation
- Avoid old object links
- Avoid finalizers and cleaners

### [Objects common methods](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods)

**Examples:**

* [Override equals() properly](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods/equals/README.MD)
* [Override hashcode() properly](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods/hashcode/README.MD)
* [Always override toString()](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods/to_string/README.MD)
* [Be careful with clone()](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods/clone/README.MD)
* [Use Comparable](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_methods/comparable/README.MD)

### [Classes and interfaces](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes)

**Examples:**

* [Make class visibility as less as possible](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes/visibility/README.MD)
* [Use access methods](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes/methods/README.MD)
* [Design immutable classes](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes/immutability/README.MD)
* [Use composition over inheritance](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes/composition/README.MD)
* [Use documented classes when inheritance needed](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/classes/documented_inheritance/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Use interfaces instead abstract classes
- Use default methods for backward compatibility
- Use interfaces for creation types only (don't use as constant holders etc.)
- Use class hierarchy over descriptor classes
- Use static inner classes instead of non-static ones
- Always have 1 top-level class in file

### [Generics](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/generics)

**Examples:**

* [Avoid Raw types](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/generics/raw/README.MD)
* [Fix all compiler issues](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/generics/notifications/README.MD)
* [Use lists instead of arrays](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/generics/arrays/README.MD)
* [Always use @SafeVarargs](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/generics/varargs/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Generics are better than class cast
- Generic methods are useful and better than class cast
- Remember **PECS** - producer extends, consumer super

### [Enumerations and annotations](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/enumerations)

**Examples:**

* [Use EnumSet instead bit maps](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/enumerations/enumset/README.MD)
* [Use EnumMap](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/enumerations/enummap/README.MD)
* [Use marker interfaces for type check](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/enumerations/markers/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Prefer enumerations to int constants
- Always use fields instead of ```ordinal```
- Use interfaces when need to extend enums
- Prefer annotations over naming conventions
- Always use ```@Override```

---

### [Lambdas and threads](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/lambdas)

**Examples:**

* [Use parallel streams carefully](src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/lambdas/parallel/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes
- Use method references if needed (shorter and easier to understand)
- Reuse standard functional interfaces
- Return collections, not streams
