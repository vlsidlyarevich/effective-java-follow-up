# Effective Java follow-up

This is not a copyright, just my abstract of "Effective java 3rd edition"
written by [Joshua Bloch](https://twitter.com/joshbloch). I've tried to memorize the most attractive things for me, and
write some examples with easy navigation for future usages.

Please, read book first!=)

### [Object creation/destruction](#src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation)

**Examples:**

* [Use static factory method if needed](#src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/sfm/README.MD)
* [Use builder when multiple params](#src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/builder/README.MD)
* [Use try-with-resources instead of try-finally](#src/main/java/com/github/vlsidlyarevich/effectivejava/followup/object_creation/twr/README.MD)

**Advices:**

- Create and fetch singletons by private constructor or enum
- Use private constructor for non-creatable objects
- Use DI everywhere
- Avoid extra Object creation
- Avoid old object links
- Avoid finalizers and cleaners
